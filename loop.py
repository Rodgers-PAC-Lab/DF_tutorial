##NOTES: Want to use this to mess around with looping through the rows of a dataframe later.

speed= [0.25,0.1,0.25]
varience= 0.1
for sp in speed:
    if sp == 0.25:
        # if varience == 0.0001:
        #     condition = 1
        # elif varience == 0.01:
        #     condition = 2
        # elif varience == 0.1:
        #     condition = 3
        # else:
        #     condition = 'unknown varience'
    else:
        condition = 'nah'
